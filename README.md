In July of 2023, I participated in Capital One's Technology Internship Program's Hackathon. Here, I was tasked with building out an application that improves the quality of associates' day-to-day tasks. Upon several rounds of ideating and iterations, I developed the concept for TimeWise. TimeWise is cost management tool delivered via Chrome Extension that allows associates to determine the cost of a potential meeting time based on proprietary calculations<sup>*</sup>

<sup>*</sup>proprietary calculations == use of the publicly available managerial level of each employee in the meeting to estimate each member's hourly rate
